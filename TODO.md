# TODO

- Detect when splines form a loop
- Enemies / goals to loop around
- use https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/classes/class_meshdatatool.html#class-meshdatatool to deform coaster-steel-straigt.glm (or coaster-steeltrack.glm)
- reorganize .glb files in coaster-kit into subdirectories, but find out how to fix up their texture references after moving them
