# TODO

- ~~Detect when splines form a loop~~
- Game Manager:
  - Time limit
  - Looping Green "O"s increases your time. Time increase is nonlinear (probably triangular numbers) to encourage big combos
  - Looping Red "X"s invalidates the loop. Maybe also have a time penalty?
  - More "X"s appear over time
  - Spawn "O"s so you can always make a combo, but never have so many that you can set the timer over some threshold with a big combo.
- UI:
  - ~~Show time and score~~
- Game world
  - ~~Switch from plane to moving around sphere~~
  - ~~Sphere controls~~
  - ~~Camera controls~~
  - Possibly have faint X-Ray vision to see objects on the other side of the planet?
  - delete end of tail so it's impossible to "bisect" the world. i.e tail length should always be < sphere circumference
  - maybe make the sphere slowly grow over time?
- remove template stuff
  - i18n
- Actually decent art / polish
  - tron / geometry wars low-poly aestetic?
  - techno music
  - use https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/classes/class_meshdatatool.html#class-meshdatatool to deform mesh for path?
  - sfx for
    - X and O spawning
    - completeing loops
